Troubleshooting
----------------
The official BitPay support website should always be your first reference for

<strong>Other troubleshooting tips:</strong>

1. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is
   updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
2. Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double
   check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
3. Check the system error log file (usually the web server error log) for any errors during BitPay 
   payment attempts. If you contact BitPay support, they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose 
   the problem.
